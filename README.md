## Version 1
With lots of back-end improvements and the addition of Import / Export OTF, Glyphr Studio has reached
Version 1 status.  There are still many features left to add, and rough edges to clean up.  But, expect 
a much faster release cadence than the Beta time-frame.  Bug fixes and new features will be pushed to the 
site the moment they are finished!

## Feedback
As always, there is kind of a running list of feature ideas over at the [Issues List]( https://github.com/mattlag/Glyphr-Studio/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open).

## Contributing
I'm an interaction designer by trade, and have decided to use Glyphr Studio as a giant crash course in JavaScript and HTML5.  Since this is my first major HTML5/JS app, there are many opportunities for growth & improvement - for both code, and collaborative development styles.

If you’d like to contribute a feature or bug fix, please make sure to search the issue tracker first, your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in master.  After researching, please feel free to fork and send a pull request.
